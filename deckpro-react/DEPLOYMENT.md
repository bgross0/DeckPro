## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Production deployment
vercel --prod
```
Configuration file `vercel.json` is already included in the project.

### Option 2: Netlify
```bash
# Drag and drop the 'dist' folder to Netlify
# Or use CLI:
npm i -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```
Configuration file `netlify.toml` is already included in the project.

### Option 3: Static Hosting (AWS S3, GitHub Pages)
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Upload contents of 'dist' folder to your hosting service
```

### Build Configuration
The project uses Vite 6.3 with the following optimizations:
- Code splitting for vendor chunks (react, konva, ui libraries)
- Terser minification with console/debugger removal
- Disabled source maps for production
- Chunk size limit: 1000KB

## Post-Deployment

### Monitoring
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Test all core features
3. Verify responsive design on mobile
4. Check performance metrics

### Known Issues to Watch
- Canvas performance on older devices (mitigated with performance optimizations)
- Touch controls on mobile devices (fully implemented and tested)
- Memory usage with large deck designs (managed with proper cleanup)
- Browser compatibility for modern features (PWA, ResizeObserver)

## Rollback Plan
1. Keep previous build artifacts
2. Use hosting provider's rollback feature
3. Or redeploy previous git commit:
   ```bash
   git checkout <previous-commit>
   npm install
   npm run build
   # Deploy
   ```

## Support
For issues, check:
- Browser console for errors
- Network tab for failed requests
- Application state in React DevTools
