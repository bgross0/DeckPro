### Critical Bug Fixes

#### 1. Post Positioning Error (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Posts were positioned at deck edge instead of under beams
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect coordinate calculation in post.js
- **Fix**: Posts now positioned at `deckWidth - cantilever` (beam location)
- **Impact**: Ensures structural integrity and code compliance

#### 2. Cantilever Calculation Error (CRITICAL)  
- **Issue**: Beam selection used full deck width instead of back-span for IRC lookup
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect parameter in cantilever-optimizer.js
- **Fix**: Beam calculations now use `backSpan` for proper IRC table lookup
- **Impact**: Accurate structural calculations and material selection

#### 3. Integration Errors (HIGH)
- **Issue**: References to moved functions causing runtime errors
- **Root Cause**: Modularization broke existing function calls
- **Fix**: Updated all references to use new utility module APIs
- **Impact**: Application stability and reliability
