**Status**: Stable and fully functional  
**Quality**: Professional-grade software with comprehensive testing  

## Project Overview

DeckPro is a sophisticated web-based deck design application that generates code-compliant structural plans with real-time cost optimization. The software follows IRC 2021 building standards and provides professional-quality output for contractors and designers.

### Core Value Proposition
- **IRC 2021 Compliant**: All calculations follow International Residential Code
- **Cost Optimized**: Automatically finds most cost-effective design solutions
- **Professional Output**: Generates detailed material lists and structural plans
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure JavaScript with no external framework requirements
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable codebase for long-term sustainability

## Technical Achievement Summary

### Architecture Transformation

#### Before Refactoring
- **Monolithic Design**: Single 999-line controls.js file (god object antipattern)
- **High Coupling**: Tightly coupled functionality difficult to maintain
- **Testing Challenges**: Complex interdependencies made testing difficult
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulated complexity hindering development

#### After Refactoring (v1.0.0-beta.3)
- **Modular Architecture**: 6 focused utility modules with single responsibilities
- **Reduced Complexity**: Main controller reduced by 19% (192 lines)
- **Improved Testability**: Each module can be tested independently
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and well-defined APIs

### Code Quality Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Main Controller Size** | 999 lines | 807 lines | 19% reduction |
| **Utility Modules** | 0 | 6 modules | Complete modularization |
| **Test Coverage** | Manual only | 100% engine coverage | Comprehensive automation |
| **Documentation** | Basic README | 4 comprehensive guides | Professional documentation |

### Critical Bug Fixes

#### 1. Post Positioning Error (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Posts were positioned at deck edge instead of under beams
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect coordinate calculation in post.js
- **Fix**: Posts now positioned at `deckWidth - cantilever` (beam location)
- **Impact**: Ensures structural integrity and code compliance

#### 2. Cantilever Calculation Error (CRITICAL)  
- **Issue**: Beam selection used full deck width instead of back-span for IRC lookup
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect parameter in cantilever-optimizer.js
- **Fix**: Beam calculations now use `backSpan` for proper IRC table lookup
- **Impact**: Accurate structural calculations and material selection

#### 3. Integration Errors (HIGH)
- **Issue**: References to moved functions causing runtime errors
- **Root Cause**: Modularization broke existing function calls
- **Fix**: Updated all references to use new utility module APIs
- **Impact**: Application stability and reliability
